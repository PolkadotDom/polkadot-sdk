title: Validator disabling strategy in runtime

      On each committed offence (no matter slashable or not) the offending validator will be
      disabled for a whole era.

      The disabling strategy in staking pallet is no longer hardcoded but abstracted away via
      `DisablingStrategy` trait. The trait contains a single function (make_disabling_decision) which
      is called for each offence. The function makes a decision if (and which) validators should be
      disabled. A default implementation is provided - `UpToThresholdDisablingStrategy`. It
      will be used on Kusama and Polkadot. In nutshell `UpToThresholdDisablingStrategy`
      disables offenders up to the configured threshold (1/3 of the validators in the active set by
      default). Offending validators are not disabled for offences in previous eras. The threshold is
      controlled via `DISABLING_LIMIT_FACTOR` (a generic parameter of
      `UpToThresholdDisablingStrategy`).

        Renames `OffendingValidators` storage item to `DisabledValidators` and changes its type from
        `Vec<(u32, bool)>` to `Vec<u32>`.
